#chatbot
Sprint 1:
Soccer Game Time site
1. Find apis to get game times
2. Figure out what format we get data in and create database tables
3. Start Creating UI to display game times

Sprint 2:
1. Populate database with dummy data
2. Display dummy data from front end
3. Start caching game time data in database
4. Serve game data to front end

Sprint 3:
1. Build out specific game time info, links, etc
2. Add UI flexibility to restrict game info to specific teams/ regions/ leagues?
3. Add cron job to collect game time info for database.

Sprint 4:
1. Integrate basic chat bot functionality for specific game time questions
2. User specific data stored? So each user has certain league games that show.
3. Chat bot extra features?

Ideas: for each game display which network is hosting the game. And possibly provide links to take you right to the game.

Long-term: We want to let the user enter a human-readable question. Interpret what they are asking, make collect the data and serve it back to them.
